A simplified tool to lookup your PUBG stats of lifetime just by entering your in-game player username (i.e Lucky-TV_et) and the tool will lookup your name in the PUBG PC Steam database managed by PUBG Developer API and search for most relevant players stats of all time of player's gameplay. ðŸŽ®

The stats will contain the following attributes:
- Total Kills
- All-time damage dealt to the enemies
- Headshots
- Longest Kills
- Vehicles Destroyed

and a lot more and not confined to these attributes only, adding more with time...
